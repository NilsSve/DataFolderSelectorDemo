The DataFlex Order Entry sample application's Order.src program has been changed to showcase how to use
the DataFolderSelector library logic in an application. See: https://github.com/NilsSve/Library-DataFolderSelector
The Data Folder Selector Utility helps users select which Data folder to use when a program starts.

See: oClientArea for the Order.src program, where the DataFolderSelector.dg is being used.
     That is all it takes to use the logic! 
     Well almost, you also need to compile the SetupDataFolders.src program once.
